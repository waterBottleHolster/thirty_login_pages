# Thirty Login/Registration Pages in 30 days Challenge

## Elevator Pitch
The point of this project is to attempt to make thirty unique login pages and registration pages
for a mock website within the span of a month.  This will force me to focus on quantity rather 
than quality.

## Guidelines
Although the point is to focus on the html/css I will use a flask backend with a working login 
system since once it's setup I shouldn't have to look at it again.  To test the different templates,
I can just change the template that is rendered in the view function.

No attached stylesheets, just do all the styling in the head tag or inline.  This isn't proper, but it 
makes testing much faster, especially on my laptop where clearing the cache everytime gets tedious.

## #1 - Dark Theme w/ Red
Channelled my inner Cold Lake Freeze for this one.

## #2 - Vanilla Theme
I can't figure out all of the form control formatting included in Bootstrap so I'll go back to basics.
Pick a theme that is blue and white by default.
